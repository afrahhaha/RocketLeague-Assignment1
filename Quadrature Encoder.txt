Quadrature Encoder

the encoder has two channels A and B that then common in contact with the common pin C and lead to the formation of two square waves 90 out of phase.

- in clockwise direction
	channel B comes before channel A
			A	B
            state 0:    0       0  = both low
	    state 1:    0       1  = A low, B high   0001
	    state 2:    1       1  = A high,B high   0111
            state 3:    1       0  = A high,B low    1110
            state 0:    0       0  = both low        1000

- in counterclockwise direction
	channel A comes before channel B
			A	B
            state 0:    0       0  = both low
	    state 1:    1       0  = A high, B low   0010
	    state 2:    1       1  = A high,B high   1011
            state 3:    0       1  = A low,B high    1101
            state 0:    0       0  = both low        0100

clockwise if stateA= stateB 
counterclockwise if stabe A!=stateB
